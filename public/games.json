Elden Ring is a genre-defining action RPG set in a vast, seamless open world created through a collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki (Dark Souls) and George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire).The world is broken; the Elden Ring has been shattered, and its fragments are held by the twisted, powerful demigod offspring of Queen Marika. As an exile returning to a land of fallen glory, you must navigate diverse landscapes—from golden plains and suffocating swamps to crumbling gothic castles.

Leaving the blood-soaked shores of ancient Greece behind, Kratos has sought a quiet life in the frozen wilds of Midgard. However, following the death of his wife, Faye, he must venture across the perilous Nine Realms of Norse mythology to fulfill her final wish: scattering her ashes from the highest peak in the lands. For the first time, Kratos does not travel alone; he is joined by his young son, Atreus, forcing the former God of War to suppress his legendary rage and learn what it truly means to be a father.The gameplay is a masterclass in cinematic action, presented entirely through a seamless, no-cut camera lens that never leaves the characters. Combat has been completely reimagined, replacing the classic chained blades with the Leviathan Axe—a magical weapon that can be hurled and summoned back with bone-crunching impact. Together with Atreus’s bow support, players engage in tactical, over-the-shoulder battles against Draugr, Trolls, and the powerful Aesir gods.", "ratings": 4.9, "developer": "Santa Monica Studio" },
